# Multify

Multify allows your clients to preemptively see stock levels for all variants of a product, and order multiple quantities of each one simultaneously with a single Add To Cart click. Perfect for wholesale Shopify sites handling bulk orders.

# How it works

As you can only add a single variant in a given call to the Shopify API, Multify will queue up your orders and fire off each cart addition in succession, it even has a max range set on the variant dropdown to stop over ordering based on its stock level, and greying out sold out items.

# How to use
